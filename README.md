# BinPackingProblem
A one dimensional container loading problem using Next Fit and also displaying Bin contents.

In the bin packing problem, objects of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of volume V in a way that minimizes the number of bins used. In computational complexity theory, it is a combinatorial NP-hard problem. The decision problem (deciding if objects will fit into a specified number of bins) is NP-complete.

The dataset used is acquired from: https://www2.wiwi.uni-jena.de/Entscheidung/binpp/index.htm and works on the ones with 50 items and a bin size of 100.
